<!-- Homework#1 - Easy -->
<!--To instructor: I need to completee this but was unable to do so in time and
    I take full respoisibility.  I need to add the article, multiple headings as
    an absolute to the section.  I will complete this but due to the time I would
    like to submit this as is and contine working over the weekend prior to class
    on the 20th of February.  I also plan on complelting the recommended 
    assignment but felt mastery over this one first was necessary.
    I would also like to note that I did not provide myself enough time to  
    complete this assignment and that will be rectified in all future assignments.
